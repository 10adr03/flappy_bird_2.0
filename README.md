## Flappy Bird 2.0
*This project contains an improvised version of the 'Flappy Bird' game, made with Unity 2D software in my first year of college.*

## How to download the game
1. *Unzip the flappy_bird_2.0 file.*<br>
2. *In the folder with the acronym you will find 3 files. Click on the file named 'My Project.exe'.*<br> 
3. *Fun fact: you don't need unity to run the game, enjoy ;).*<br> 

## P.S: you control the bird with space.

## Game features
1. *Randomly generated obstacles: Tubes that move across the screen in a zig-zag pattern.*<br>
2. *Scoring system: The player receives points for each tube avoided.*<br>
3. *Losing mechanic: The game ends when the bird touches the edge of the screen or collides with a pipe.*<br>
