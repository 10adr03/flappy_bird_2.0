## *Flappy Bird 2.0*
This project contains an improvised version of the 'Flappy Bird' game, made with Unity 2D software in my first year of university.

## *How to download the game*
1.Unzip the flappy_bird_2.0 file<br>
2.In the folder with the acronym you will find 3 files. Click on the file named "My Project.exe"<br> 
3.Fun fact: you don't need unity to run the game, enjoy;)<br> 

P.S: you control the bird with space

## *Game features*
1.Randomly generated obstacles: Tubes that move across the screen in a zigzag pattern.<br>
2.Scoring system: The player receives points for each tube avoided.<br>
3.Losing mechanic: The game ends when the bird touches the edge of the screen or collides with a pipe.<br>
