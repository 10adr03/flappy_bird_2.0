~This project contains an improvised version of the 'Flappy Bird' game, made with Unity 2D software in my first year of university.

~How to download the game 
1.Unzip the flappy_bird_2.0 file
2.In the folder with the acronym you will find 3 files. Click on the file named "My Project.exe" 
3.Fun fact: you don't need unity to run the game, enjoy;) 

P.S: you control the bird with space
